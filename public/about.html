<h1>About Raye</h1>
<p>Sky Striker Ace - Raye was released in 2018 in the set "Dark Saviors". She instantly came to dominate the meta and show these pathetic fools what's up!</p>

<p>Later on they decided to restrict and ban many of her cards. But that wouldn't stop her! She continued to destroy every opponent in sight without hesitation! It was clear no matter what KonamiÂ© tried it wouldn't work to stop the most powerful deck of them all!</p>

<p>Now they are started to unrestrict most of the cards, and they are mostly fully free from the banlist.. They will soon see what a huge mistake this was and the devestation it will bring to the meta! No one stands a chance!</p>
